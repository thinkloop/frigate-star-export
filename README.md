# Frigate Star Export Node.js Script

## Overview

The 0.14 release of Frigate introduces a breaking change that will result in the loss of favorited events. 
To mitigate this, the release notes advise exporting any starred/favorite events before upgrading. 
This script automates that process.

## How It Works

The Node.js script prompts for a Frigate URL, loads all starred videos, and exports them one by one, pausing in between based on the video's length. 
Exported files appear in your regular exports folder.

Since Frigateâ€™s export process is asynchronous, some errors may go unreported. 
Monitor your logs and compare the number of exported files to the number of triggered exports to identify any missing files.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the main file:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:thinkloop/frigate-star-export.git
cd frigate-star-export
node ./frigate-star-export.js
```
